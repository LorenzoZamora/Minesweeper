## Minesweeper by Team 2

Welcome to our version of the classic game **Minesweeper**!

There are 3 different levels available to play:
<br/>*EASY* - 8x8 Board | 10 Mines | 10 Flags
<br/>*MEDIUM* - 16x16 Board | 40 Mines | 40 Flags
<br/>*HARD* - 16x30 Board | 99 Mines | 90 Flags

To win the game, you need to flag all of the mines that are
on the board. But if you click a mine, then you get blown up
and lose the game!

Additionally, your High Score (how fast you clear the board
and not get blown up) is also saved in between game sessions.

Hope you have fun, and get to sweeping those mines!
