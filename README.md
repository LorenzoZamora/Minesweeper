## Minesweeper [CSCI2300 â€” Object-Oriented Software Design]

~ Welcome to our version of the classic game **Minesweeper**! ~

There are 3 different difficulty levels available to play:
<br/>*EASY* - 8x8 Board | 10 Mines | 10 Flags
<br/>*MEDIUM* - 16x16 Board | 40 Mines | 40 Flags
<br/>*HARD* - 16x30 Board | 99 Mines | 90 Flags

To win the game, you simply need to flag all of the mines that are 
on the board; there is no need to open all the non-mine tiles. But, 
if you happen to click on a mine, then you get blown up and lose the 
game!

Additionally, your High Score (how fast you clear the board and not 
get blown up) is also saved after successful minesweeping. It is also 
available between different game sessions, so you always have a goal 
to strive for and keep coming back to!

Hope you have fun, and get to sweeping those mines!
