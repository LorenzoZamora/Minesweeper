## Minesweeper [CSCI2300 â€” Object-Oriented Software Design]

~ Welcome to our version of the classic game **Minesweeper**! ~

There are 3 different difficulty levels available to play:
<br/>*EASY* - 8x8 Board | 10 Mines | 10 Flags
<br/>*MEDIUM* - 16x16 Board | 40 Mines | 40 Flags
<br/>*HARD* - 16x30 Board | 99 Mines | 90 Flags

To win the game, you simply need to flag all of the mines that are 
on the board; there is no need to open all of the non-mine tiles. 
But, if you happen to click on a tile that has a mine under it, then 
you get blown up and lose the game!

Additionally, your High Score (how fast you clear the board and not 
get blown up) is also saved after successful minesweeping, so long as
as you set a new, faster time than the existing scores. Also, these 
High Scores are available between different game sessions, so you can
quit at anytime and keep coming back to try and beat them as you wish.

Hope you have fun, and get to sweeping those mines!
